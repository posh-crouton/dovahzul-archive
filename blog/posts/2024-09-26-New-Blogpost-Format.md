## New Blogpost Format!

G'devening! 

Short and sweet one today, a quick update as I learn more and more about how to actually run a blog. 

So, the blogposts on this page are now a bit better organised. You'll find them all in [blog/posts](https://github.com/posh-crouton/dovahzul-archive/tree/main/blog/posts) on the repo, in markdown format. They're transpiled to HTMl and injected into this site when it deploys (or, in layman's terms: they get here by magic). 

In future I plan to extend this to also put these posts onto an RSS feed, and potentially add logic such that the rest of the repo can also be transpiled to HTML and automatically put onto the website. Overall, making deployment easier and making it easier to follow the updates to the site!

That's all from me for tonight. Back soon with more updates!
