## Repo is back to public! I found a potential vulnerability on bethesda.net 
<span class="text-secondary">2024-11-10</span>

On 1<sup>st</sup> November, 2024, I received a notification on my GitHub account about potential API keys being leaked in one of my repos. This one, in fact. 

The next day, when I noticed this notification, I immediately privated the repository and reached out to @BethesdaSupport on Twitter, asking for a DM to disclose a potential vulnerability on the website. With no luck on that front, I then opened a ticket on help.bethesda.net. Bethesda's web team is now aware of the potential security incident, though I don't expect to receive any more updates. 

The vulnerability in question? 3 exposed google API keys on bethesda.net, which could be found by downloading certain pages. 

The repository is back to being public now.
