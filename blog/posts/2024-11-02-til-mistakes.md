## Discrepencies found on TIL
<span class="text-secondary">2024-11-02</span>

So, regarding my recent post about the official translation list provided to me by The Impreial Library's Lady N! 

Today, I went through the official translation list and compared it to the [current information on TIL](https://www.imperial-library.info/content/lang-dragon), and I found 12 discrepencies (given that the Bethesda file is a primary source, one might even say "errors", but that seems a little harsh on the hard-working wiki maintainers!) 

TIL seems to contain the following typos: 
* "Daniik" should be "Daanik"
* "Fahluann" Should be "Fahluaan"
* "Tovinaan" should be "Tovitaan"
* "Vahruvik" should be "Vahrukiv"

Additionally, I found that TIL doesn't mention the following words: 
* Mein (full/filled)
* Neiz (nice)
* Saan (lose)
* Sik (run/word)
* Sossedov (dragonblood)
* Suleykaar (powerful)
* Viidost (poison)
* Zein (worship) 

I've replied to Lady N's email today to list out these discrepencies, in the hope that someone at TIL might be willing to make these corrections to the wiki. I'll post here if I recieve a response. 

That's all for now!
