<span class="dragon-alphabet">drem yol lok 4rk pruz4 grind</span> to the few people who will see this page!

Posh here, creator of the [posh-crouton/dovahzul-archive](https://github.com/posh-crouton/dovahzul-archive) GitHub repository, dedicated to the archival and preservation of content relating to Dovahzul.

It seems that somewhere between the 12th of June 2024 and today (14th July), [thuum.org](https://thuum.org/) went offline. Thuum.org was a collection of many resources to aid in the study of Dovahzul<sup>[1]</sup>. With it gone, this site attempts to preserve its legacy.

Here you'll find dictionaries and grammatical guides, fonts <span class="dragon-alphabet">med d1r</span>, and more, from various sources across the web, useful for studying Dovahzul. I may even write some of my own guides!

With no current hosting cost (if ever we get enough content, the hosting will be cheap), I don't expect this site to go anywhere any time soon - but even if it does, all of the content and resources are open-source on GitHub as mentioned above, which means they'll still be here, as well as an in-depth history of this site.

If you've spotted a mistake on this site, or believe you have something valuable to contribute, please get in touch! [I've removed my email from this part, people keep scraping the site and sending me emails for web services. I'm sure you can figure out a way to get in touch - look on GitHub!]

Well, that's all I have for now, I think! Have fun!

\- Posh
