## Recent &amp; Upcoming Site Updates 
<span class="text-secondary">2024-09-07</span>

Hi everyone. Been a while!

First of all: I may have fumbled a bit and lost the last blogpost. The gist of it is that [thuum.org](https://thuum.org) came back online, and that this project will continue nonetheless.

As for where I've been: Life and work get quite hectic, it seems! Things are cooling down now, so I can divert more of my attention to passion projects like this one.

First, and probably least important,is adding syntax highlighting to this site! You can see it in action with the CSS sections in [the fonts page](./fonts.html). This might also appear in other pages across the siteas it develops.

Secondly, I've added a download of [The Imperial Library](https://www.imperial-library.info/)'s dictionary page to the repository. You can find its source [here](https://github.com/posh-crouton/dovahzul-archive/tree/main/dictionaries/html/ImperialLibrary). We'll come back to The Imperial Library later.

Next up: I added a file containing all the books from *The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim*, which can be found [here](https://github.com/posh-crouton/dovahzul-archive/tree/main/books). The file is in .epub format, so it can probably be used with your favourite e-reader. If you don't already have an e-reader, but are interested, I'd personally recommend [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/), which works on all common desktop operating systems.

Coming towards the end, I've also added a Dovahzul Dictionary app for Android made by Pedro Fernandez-Godinho, found [here](https://github.com/posh-crouton/dovahzul-archive/tree/main/apps/net.fernandezgodinho.pedro.dovahzuldictionary). Note that these APKs are extremely old and likely do not work with modern Android devices.

Finally, I've been reaching out to people who might be able to make valuable contributions to this archive. This morning, I've sent an e-mail to one [Dmitry Narkevich](https://dmitry.lol/), developer of [BabelDovah](https://github.com/posh-crouton/dovahzul-archive/blob/main/apps/BabelDovah/Index.md), to see if he can provide an APK and/or source for his app. I've also sent a reddit message to [Lady Nerevar](https://ladynerevar.com/) of The Imperial Library, also known as Lady N, asking if they're at liberty to provide the original communications with Bethesda containing the official dictionary as referenced in [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/qrtriy/official_dragon_dictionary/). With permission from Lady N and Mr. Narkevich, I will share any developments here.

As for what's next: I want to give some more love to the website, because let's be honest, who wants to trawl through a git repo to find what they want? Not even me, and that's literally my job. I'll also be looking into making an updated version of the Dovahzul translator, but that will take quite a while as it's a rather big undertaking.

That's all from me for today. Keep an eye out for more developments!
