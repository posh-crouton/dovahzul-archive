Well, good day to all! I'm back with a small update.

Firstly: We have a new domain name! Welcome to [unslaad.org](https://unslaad.org)! <span class="dragon-alphabet">unsl1d</span> (strong adjective): Eternal/Unending/Ceaseless. A persistent archive of Dovahzul materials. Thanks to <span class="dragon-alphabet">lon3zrath</span> (Loniizrath) on the Unofficial Thuum.org Discord server for the name suggestion, and to <span class="dragon-alphabet">s4lon4l</span> (SahLoNahl) for helping this old-school desktop developer set up DNS.

On that note, a little personal advice for anyone developing a website: don't put a `mailto:` link with your email address on your site. I've learned this the hard way. In the mere hours we've had this new domain name, I've recieved no less than 7 emails offering web design services, and have since removed the anchor tag around my email address. Why advertise web development services to people who've already developed their sites, I don't know.

Anywhosies - if you want to share this site with others (which I do encourage, sharing in Dovahzul and potentially contributing to the archival efforts), just send them to [unslaad.org](https://unslaad.org/)!

With that, I end this rather brief post. Posh out.
