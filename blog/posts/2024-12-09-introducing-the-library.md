## Introducing the unslaad.org library, plus more future plans
<span class="text-secondary">2024-12-09</span>

Hi everyone! So, I'd meant to work on this last weekend... but I got stuck in Belfast on a business trip. 

Today, I've added a new page to unslaad.org: the library! Find a link to it along the left of the screen. 
The library will be used to catalog any and all materials relating to the study of Dovahzul. As of now, 
I've added links to 2 books published by [Prima Games](https://primagames.com), both of which contain 
sections related to Dovahzul. 

I've been having a few ideas for tools to build into this website. One such idea is a "translatability estimator", 
a tool that takes in a block of text and shows a rough estimate of what percentage of the words have an equivalent 
in Dovahzul. Another is a pronunciation guide, applying the phonetic rules we know to the words we have and generating 
audio files based upon them. 

Come the holiday season, I'm planning to dediate a significant amount of time to the development of this site, including a UI 
overhaul, improved build process for the site, and other structural improvements to the repository. Additionally, I'll be 
continuing my research into Dovahzul and sharing anything new I find, in the library and potentially other places. 

That's all from me for today, folks!
