## Official Translation List Update
<span class="text-secondary">2024-10-31</span>

Happy halloween/samhain to those who celebrate! 

I'm back today with some good and bad news regarding my earlier post (2024-09-07 "Recent &amp; Upcoming Site Updates"), in which I shared that I'd reached out to Lady N of The Imperial Library, asking if she might be able to share the official list of translations that was provided to TIL by Bethesda. 

On Friday 18th October, I received an e-mail in response. The good news is, Lady N has kindly shared this official translation sheet with me. Unfortunately, she's requested that I not distribute the document, and I intend to honour this request. 

However, Lady N does add that "Everything here should also be on TIL with the official label" ([link](https://www.imperial-library.info/content/lang-dragon)), so the information is available to the public. 

Hopefully I can find some way of bringing value from this information while respecting Lady N's request. 

Again, a huge thanks to lady N for sharing this document with me.

That's all from me for tonight!
