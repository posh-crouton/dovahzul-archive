                            <a href="https://unslaad.org">unslaad.org</a> is a website wrapper for the <a href="https://github.com/posh-crouton/dovahzul-archive">posh-crouton/dovahzul-archive</a> GitHub repository.  
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            On some day between the 12<sup>th</sup> and 14<sup>th</sup> of June, 2024, the website <a href="https://thuum.org/">thuum.org</a> went down. This wasn't entirely unheard of - there had been outages before - but this time, it remained down for over a month. Its maintainer, who goes by <a href="https://www.thuum.org/viewuser.php?author=1">paarthurnax</a>, can be difficult to contact, so we weren't sure if the site would ever come back online. (Thankfully, some time later, the site was restored, and remains online as of the time of writing).  
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In reponse to the possibility of <a href="https://thuum.org">thuum.org</a> being lost, on the 14<sup>th</sup> of July 2024, I started this effort to preserve knowledge relating to Dovahzul. With the help of some people from the <a href="https://discord.gg/vAJmAJn">Unofficial Thuum.org Discord</a> server, I've been collecting resources relating to the language, and building this repository with the following principles:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>The archive is open-source.</b> All archived content can be found in the repository, licenses permitting. If ever a license does not permit redistribution, I will do my best effort to catalog it in a permissible manner, and point to where it can be accessed. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>The site is static.</b> For those non-technical, this means that its hosting costs are so negligible that GitHub kindly hosts it for free on GitHub pages. It also means that there is mininal communication with a server - no personal data is collected, and each page loads once, and does not communicate with the server again. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>The archive isn't going away.</b> Or so I hope. <span class="dragon-alphabet">unsl1d</span>, <i>undying</i> - I have no plans to delete the content of this archive. So long as GitHub exists, and no external action is taken to take down the content here, this project will continue providing knowledge to anyone who seeks it. 
                        </p>
