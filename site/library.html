                <h2>Prima Games Official Guides</h2>
                <p>
                    US videogame strategy guide publisher <a href="https://primagames.com">Prima Games</a>
                    has published two official game guides for <i>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</i> and
                    <i>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Legendary Edition</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For copyright reasons, we cannot host copies of these books on this website or its
                    associated repository. If you're looking to get your hands on a copy for reference,
                    consider asking at your local library.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Their first publication, written by David S. J. Hodgson and Steve Stratton, was
                    <a href="https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9780307895479"><i>
                            The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Official Game Guide</i></a>, published 2012.
                    The guide includes 3 pages (p. 645-647) on the dragon language, sharing a key for
                    the alphabet, some common words, and translations of the word walls from the base game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Their second publication, written by Hodgson alone, was entitled
                    <a href="https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9780307895509"><i>
                            The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Legendary Edition Official Game Guide</i></a>, published in
                    2013.
                    Pages 1096-1099 build upon the previous iteration by translating the new word walls from the game's
                    Hearthfire, Dawnguard and Dragonborn DLCs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In an article published on Prima Games' website on November 7th, 2011, author David Hodgson writes
                    that he and his co-author Steve Stratton had "a massive support structure from both Bethesda and
                    Prima",
                    which suggests that they may have had access to internal information that was never released to the
                    public
                    or made it into the final game. This explains why some words in their translation list are not known
                    to be
                    used anywhere in-game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Both books contained a reference to an online word list, which has since been removed, though copies
                    remain on the internet archive.
                </p>

                <h2>Prima Games List</h2>
                <p>
                    Companion to the official game guides, Prima Games published an
                    <a
                        href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151231230524/http://www.primagames.com/games/elder-scrolls-v-skyrim/primaguides/292/gameplay/8311/1">
                        online list of translations</a>. The list was removed from the site sometime between
                    May 17<sup>th</sup> and June 14<sup>th</sup> 2016, though it is still accessible via the Wayback
                    Machine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The online list contains translations for words that do not appear in-game or in the official game
                    guides.
                    Interestingly, it lists <span class="dragon-alphabet">sik</span> to mean "rune" or "word", while
                    Bethesda's internal
                    documentation lists it to mean "run" or "word". Perhaps this was a typo on Bethesda's part that
                    Prima assumed to correct.
                </p>

                <h2><a href="https://thuum.org">thuum.org</a></h2>
                <p>
                    Perhaps the most well-known and significant resource pertaining to the study of Dovahzul is the
                    forum known as thuum.org. Founded on or before January 13<sup>th</sup> 2013, it was the home of the
                    Dovahzul community for many years.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, thuum.org has experienced a decline since its administrator "Paarthurnax" ceased contributing 
                    to the site after the site's 6 year anniversary in 2019. Since 2023, the forums have become plagued by bots, 
                    and the site had a month-long outage in 2024 leaving many scared that it would disappear entirely and prompting 
                    the creation of this site. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thuum.org contains an extensive dictionary as well as an impressive collection of fan-made material and 
                    thousands of forum threads. Should the site ever go down permenantly, all its content is backed up within 
                    unslaad.org's repository. 
                </p>

                <h2>The Imperial Library</h2>
                <p>
                    Founded in 1998 under the name Xanathar's Library, 
                    <a href="https://www.imperial-library.info/">The Imperial Library</a> (or "TIL" for short) 
                    is a fan site dedicated to the lore of The Elder Scrolls. As of December 2024, their 15 librarians 
                    care for over 7,000 documents, a limited number of which pertain to Dovahzul. 
                </p>

                <h2>The Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages</h2>
                <p>

                    is a collaborative source of knowledge regarding the Elder Scrolls series founded in 1995. 
                </p>

                <h2>Memrise Courses</h2>
                <p>
                    24 community-made Dovahzul courses can be found on the memrise community courses

                    since community courses were removed from the Memrise app on 31st March, 2024. 
                </p>

                     based on memrise user Nol's well-known course. According to the description, the set remains 
                     incomplete to this day.
