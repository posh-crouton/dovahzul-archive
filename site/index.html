                        <p>
                            Well, good day to all! I'm back with a small update.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Firstly: We have a new domain name! Welcome to <a href="https://unslaad.org">unslaad.org</a>!
                            <span class="dragon-alphabet">unsl1d</span> (strong adjective): Eternal/Unending/Ceaseless. 
                            A persistent archive of Dovahzul materials. Thanks to <span class="dragon-alphabet">lon3zrath</span> 
                            (Loniizrath) on the Unofficial Thuum.org Discord server for the name suggestion, and to 
                            <span class="dragon-alphabet">s4lon4l</span> (SahLoNahl) for helping this old-school desktop developer 
                            set up DNS. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On that note, a little personal advice for anyone developing a website: don't put a
                            <code>mailto:</code> link with your email address on your site. I've learned this
                            the hard way. In the mere hours we've had this new domain name, I've recieved no less
                            than 7 emails offering web design services, and have since removed the anchor tag around
                            my email address. Why advertise web development services to people who've already developed 
                            their sites, I don't know. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Anywhosies - if you want to share this site with others (which I do encourage, sharing in 
                            Dovahzul and potentially contributing to the archival efforts), just send them to 
                            <a href="https://unslaad.org/">unslaad.org</a>!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With that, I end this rather brief post. Posh out.

                            GitHub repository, dedicated to the archival and preservation of content relating to
                            Dovahzul.

                        <p>
                            It seems that somewhere between the 12th of June 2024 and today (14th July), <a
                                href="thuum.org">thuum.org</a>
                            went offline. Thuum.org was a collection of many resources to aid in the study of
                            Dovahzul<sup>[1]</sup>.
                            With it gone, this site attempts to preserve its legacy.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Here you'll find dictionaries and grammatical guides, fonts <span
                                class="dragon-alphabet">med d1r</span>,
                            and more, from various sources across the web, useful for studying Dovahzul. I may even
                            write some of my
                            own guides!

                        <p>
                            With no current hosting cost (if ever we get enough content, the hosting will be cheap), I
                            don't expect
                            this site to go anywhere any time soon - but even if it does, all of the content and
                            resources are open-source
                            on GitHub as mentioned above, which means they'll still be here, as well as an in-depth
                            history of this site.
                        </p>
