                        <p>
                            Hi everyone. Been a while!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            First of all: I may have fumbled a bit and lost the last blogpost.
                            The gist of it is that <a href="https://thuum.org">thuum.org</a> came back online,
                            and that this project will continue nonetheless.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As for where I've been: Life and work get quite hectic, it seems! Things are 
                            cooling down now, so I can divert more of my attention to passion projects like this one. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            First, and probably least important,
                            is adding syntax highlighting to this site! You can see it in action with the CSS sections
                            in <a href="./fonts.html">the fonts page</a>. This might also appear in other pages across the site 
                            as it develops. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Secondly, I've added a download of <a href="https://www.imperial-library.info/">The Imperial Library</a>'s
                            dictionary page to the repository. You can find its source 
                            <a href="https://github.com/posh-crouton/dovahzul-archive/tree/main/dictionaries/html/ImperialLibrary">here</a>.
                            We'll come back to The Imperial Library later. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Next up: I added a file containing all the books from <i>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</i>, which can be found 
                            <a href="https://github.com/posh-crouton/dovahzul-archive/tree/main/books">here</a>. The file is in .epub format, 
                            so it can probably be used with your favourite e-reader. If you don't already have an e-reader, but are interested, 
                            I'd personally recommend <a href="https://calibre-ebook.com/">Calibre</a>, which works on all common desktop operating systems.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Coming towards the end, I've also added a Dovahzul Dictionary app for Android made by Pedro Fernandez-Godinho, found <a href="https://github.com/posh-crouton/dovahzul-archive/tree/main/apps/net.fernandezgodinho.pedro.dovahzuldictionary">here</a>. Note that these APKs are extremely old and likely do not work with modern Android 
                            devices. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Finally, I've been reaching out to people who might be able to make valuable contributions to this archive. 
                            This morning, I've sent an e-mail to one <a href="https://dmitry.lol/">Dmitry Narkevich</a>, developer of <a href="https://github.com/posh-crouton/dovahzul-archive/blob/main/apps/BabelDovah/Index.md">BabelDovah</a>, to see if he can provide an APK and/or source for his app. I've also sent a reddit message to <a href="https://ladynerevar.com/">Lady Nerevar</a> of The Imperial Library, also known as Lady N, asking if they're at liberty to provide the original communications with Bethesda containing the official dictionary as referenced in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/qrtriy/official_dragon_dictionary/">this reddit post</a>. With permission from Lady N and Mr. Narkevich, I will share any developments here. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As for what's next: I want to give some more love to the website, because let's be honest, who wants to trawl through a git repo to find what they want? Not even me, and that's literally my job. I'll also be looking into making an updated version of the Dovahzul translator, but that will take quite a while as it's a rather big undertaking.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            That's all from me for today. Keep an eye out for more developments!
                        </p>

                            Well, good day to all! I'm back with a small update.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Firstly: We have a new domain name! Welcome to <a
                                href="https://unslaad.org">unslaad.org</a>!
                            <span class="dragon-alphabet">unsl1d</span> (strong adjective): Eternal/Unending/Ceaseless.
                            A persistent archive of Dovahzul materials. Thanks to <span
                                class="dragon-alphabet">lon3zrath</span>
                            (Loniizrath) on the Unofficial Thuum.org Discord server for the name suggestion, and to
                            <span class="dragon-alphabet">s4lon4l</span> (SahLoNahl) for helping this old-school desktop
                            developer
                            set up DNS.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On that note, a little personal advice for anyone developing a website: don't put a
                            <code>mailto:</code> link with your email address on your site. I've learned this
                            the hard way. In the mere hours we've had this new domain name, I've recieved no less
                            than 7 emails offering web design services, and have since removed the anchor tag around
                            my email address. Why advertise web development services to people who've already developed
                            their sites, I don't know.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Anywhosies - if you want to share this site with others (which I do encourage, sharing in
                            Dovahzul and potentially contributing to the archival efforts), just send them to
                            <a href="https://unslaad.org/">unslaad.org</a>!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With that, I end this rather brief post. Posh out.

                            Dovahzul<sup>[1]</sup>.
                            With it gone, this site attempts to preserve its legacy.
